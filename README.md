🖥 Coding Competition – README
⚠ RULE #1: This is an open book competition — you may use the internet, documentation, books, and notes.
🚫 RULE #2: No AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, etc.) are allowed. We want your thinking, not a bot’s.

📜 Overview
This competition consists of three challenges. You may use any programming language you like.
Your goal is to write the most efficient and correct solutions possible.

🏆 Prizes
The top 3 winners will receive vouchers from Jarir or Amazon.

📂 Challenges
Challenge 1 – Dataset Search
You are given two files:

dataset.txt – a list of items (one per line).

queries.txt – a list of items you need to check.

Your task:

For each query in queries.txt, output YES if it exists in dataset.txt, otherwise NO.

Output the results in results.txt, with one YES/NO per line corresponding to each query.

Your score will consider:

Correctness of the results.

Efficiency — how fast your search works on large datasets.

Challenge 2 – Decryption Puzzle
You are given the following encoded string:

Qm5tZnF6c3RrenNobm1yISBYbnQgZ3p1ZCBicXpiamRjIHNnZCBiaG9nZHEu

This string was encrypted in two steps:

A Caesar cipher shift was applied to the original text.

The result was then Base64 encoded.

Your task:

Reverse the encryption process to reveal the original message.

Clearly document your approach.

Challenge 3 – Boolean Simplification
You are given the Boolean expression:

((A and not B) or (not A and C and not B) or (A and C and not B) or (not B and not C) or ((A or C) and not B) or (not A and not B))
Your task:

Simplify this expression into its simplest form.

Provide the simplified Boolean expression and explain why it is equivalent.

📜 Rules
You may use any programming language.

Internet & notes allowed (open book).

No AI usage of any kind.

All work must be your own.

Collaboration with others is not allowed.
