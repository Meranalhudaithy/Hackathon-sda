# ANOTHER SSTORY YOU WONT GET BORED ON MY WATCHHHH
#sureeee i didnt need too code but you know i like to flex my skills


# In the museum archive, you find a note that was "double-locked."

# First lock: a Caesar shift (no key given hmmmm how will we decypher???). 
# Second lock: Base64 wrapping.

# Your job as the conservator: peel off the Base64 wrap then try every
# Caesar unshift until the sentence reads like normal English.
# Weâ€™ll rank candidates with a tiny English-ness check Not fancy just effective.
